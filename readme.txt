Add items to your WordPress e-commerce shopping cart via Twitter. This plugin supports the largest e-commerce plugins for WordPress.

== Description ==
A lot of companies are sharing their (new) products via social media. Even friends do it via Twitter. With this plugin you as a site owner have the opportunity to come up with a unique hashtag that customers can use to add items to their shopping cart.
All automatically.

Amazon launched this feature early 2014 and it was an instant hit. Why not have the same fuctionality on your WordPress e-commerce sites? Thats right, that's what we thought as well. The only thing you need to so is install this plugin, come up with a hashtag, connect a Twitter App and start sharing that hashtag. It is really easy.

Customers needs to add their Twitter username to their account. You can use a custom plugin for that (like Twitter Profile Field) or others. You can set your own custom twitter field that this plugin can use.
Once a customer saved their Twitter username, we will collect tweets and search for products in those tweets. Once we find a product of your website we will save the tweet en add the product to the shopping cart of your website when that visitor will visit your website.
